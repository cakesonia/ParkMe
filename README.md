# ParkMe
Our project solves such a problem as wasting time searching a free parking spot.
The daily situation if you are the driver, is to find a parking spot in the direct district of the
city. To do it faster and easier you can use our app.
By using our app you can find and reserve a parking spot in the nearest parking to you. Our
app will also make you a route in GPS maps to your reserved spot. You can also see the
availability of parking spots in the direct parking so that you know is there any spots for you,
or not. Registration in the app is very simple. All that you need to do, to add your phone
number and then verificate it.
Also in the future in our app might be provided with some useful functions.
For example, the driver can choose the brand and model of his car and then the app will
choose the parking spot for him according to dimensions of the car.
We suppose to provide the scheme of parking so that the driver can choose directly that
spot which he wants. Reserved parking spots will mark by red colour, while free will mark by
green. Your parked car will have a special mark on the scheme. According to this scheme,
you can easily find where you parked your car.
Useful thing for electric car drivers will be a special mark on the map for parkings which
have car charge stations.
Weâ€™ll have cash-free payment by your own credit card which you are adding after
registration. When you take your car from the parking spot, your session of parking will be
automatically paid.
In our app, we also suppose to add notifications to make an app easier to use.
